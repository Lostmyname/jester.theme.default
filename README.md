# Jester Default Theme

This is a theme for use with Jester.

It contains base style themeing and variables used for grid sizing and colours.

This theme should be used within your project using npm.

It can then be used by importing the `./src/_styles.scss` file

Theming for individual components is found inside the component, not here.
